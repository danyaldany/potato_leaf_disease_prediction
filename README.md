1) Overview

Potato crops are vulnerable to various diseases that reduce yield and quality. This project uses deep learning (CNN) to detect and classify diseases in potato leaves such as:

* Early blight
* Late blight
* Healthy

The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset and deployed as a web app with a frontend and backend.

2)Features
    Upload a potato leaf image and get instant disease prediction.
    Clean UI built with HTML/CSS/JS (or React if applicable).
    Trained deep learning model (TensorFlow/Keras).
    REST API backend using Flask or FastAPI.
    Model saving/loading with `.h5` or `.pb`.
